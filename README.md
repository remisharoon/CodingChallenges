# CodingChallenges

Welcome to my `CodingChallenges` repository where I share my solutions to various coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal. This repository is organized by platform, with subdirectories representing different categories or difficulty levels.

## Structure

Each main directory represents a platform (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) and is subdivided into categories like difficulty levels or specific areas (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures), with further subdivision by programming language:

- **LeetCode**:
  - Easy:
    - Python
    - Java
    - Scala
    - JavaScript
  - Medium:
    - Python
    - Java
    - Scala
    - JavaScript
  - Hard:
    - Python
    - Java
    - Scala
    - JavaScript
- **HackerRank**:
